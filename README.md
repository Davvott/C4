# Connect4

My version of a Connect4 game. PyGame conversion to come.

- simple functions
- board[x][y], printed in reverse;
- position winner check converted to suit my implementation of C4

The is_position_winner() is what I like most about this implementation. Elegant and fast, I fumbled through others' versions 
of itertool, groupby, [whatever]... and then found this. Problem solved.
