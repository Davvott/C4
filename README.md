# Connect4
========================================================

My version of a Connect4 game. PyGame conversion to come.

- simple functions, run off main()
- input column slot for turn based play
- board[x][y], printed in reverse;
- is_position_winner() converted to suit my implementation of C4

The is_position_winner() is what I like most about this implementation. Elegant and fast, I fumbled through others' versions 
of itertool, groupby, etc... and then found this. Problem solved. I'm sure it's a style of algorithm with it's own name, 
but we'll get to that later.
